Kaelari's CV2R location tracker
This is designed to be used in conjunction with my item tracker but does different things. Use either or both or niether as you see fit.

Automation (FCEUX only)
It will try to mark items when you get them. and will try to mark locations as "checked" when you read text on a given screen. This is not the most reliable as any text will trigger it, talk to a townsperson or read a clue and it'll think you did the check. 

Please report any bugs or other issues. All constructive feedback is appreciated
